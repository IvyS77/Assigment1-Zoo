            The dolphin is a highly intelligent aquatic mammal with a sleek, 
            streamlined body and a distinctively expressive face. Its habitat 
            spans a broad spectrum of marine environments—from shallow coastal 
            waters to the vast, open oceans—thriving in both tropical and 
            temperate climates. Celebrated for its graceful agility, sophisticated 
            social behaviors, and remarkable echolocation skills.
