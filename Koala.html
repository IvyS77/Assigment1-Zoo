            The koala is a cherished marsupial recognized for its soft, 
            fluffy ears and a characteristically relaxed expression. 
            Native to the eucalyptus forests of Australia, it inhabits 
            a niche ecosystem where its specialized diet and lifestyle 
            allow it to thrive. Celebrated for its endearing appearance 
            and unique behavioral traits, the koala has captured the
