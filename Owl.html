            The owl is a nocturnal bird of prey celebrated for its silent 
            flight and exceptional sensory adaptations. Its remarkable ability 
            to rotate its head extensively aids in scanning its surroundings, 
            making it a formidable hunter in the dark. Inhabiting diverse 
            environments—from dense forests to open fields—the owl has long 
            intrigued cultures around the world, often symbolizing mystery and 
            wisdom.
