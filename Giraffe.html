            The giraffe is the tallest terrestrial mammal, renowned for 
            its strikingly patterned coat and elongated neck. Its natural 
            habitat spans the open savannahs, woodlands, and lightly forested 
            regions of Africa, where its unique physiology allows it to reach 
            the highest treetops for sustenance. Celebrated for its graceful 
            stature, gentle demeanor, and remarkable adaptations.
