            The tiger is a large feline with distinctively colored fur,
            and its native range is primarily concentrated in Asiaâ€™s dense 
            forests, vast grasslands, and rugged mountainous regions, spanning
            a diverse array of ecological environments from tropical to temperate. 
            It is not only one of the largest extant feline species but also widely 
            celebrated for its agile hunting skills, robust physique, and enigmatic, 
            solitary nature.
