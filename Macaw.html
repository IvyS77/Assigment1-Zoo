            The macaw is a large and vibrantly colored parrot whose native range 
            is primarily concentrated in the tropical rainforests of Central and 
            South America, encompassing dense forests, expansive grasslands, and 
            mountainous regions. It is not only one of the largest extant parrot 
            species but is also renowned for its remarkable intelligence and highly social nature.
